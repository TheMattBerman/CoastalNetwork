<h2>Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware launches television and drives viewers to sign petition to save 4,000 jobs while making progress on their bill</h2>
<span class="xn-location">DOVER, Del.</span>, <span class="xn-chron">Feb. 2, 2017</span> /PRNewswire/ --<b> </b>Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware (CPBD), the advocacy group supporting TransPerfect employees and <span class="xn-location">Delaware's</span> incorporation-driven economy, launched a new TV ad today. The ad features TransPerfect employees who have been silenced by the courts through out judicial proceedings in the <span class="xn-location">Delaware</span> Court of Chancery that ordered the dissolution of the global translation services company, TransPerfect. In response to that decision, the group has worked with members of the General Assembly, including Senator <span class="xn-person">Colin Bonini</span>, to pass a bill which would require a three-year waiting period before the Chancery Court can order the sale of a private company. After meeting with senior members of the legislature and agreeing to move forward with the Corporate Bar Committee of the Delaware Bar Association, the group worked with State Senator Bonini to temporarily withdraw the bill. CPBD is meeting with the Corporate Bar Committee next week and hopes to begin a process that will help preserve the jobs at stake.

The new ad depicts the recent rally and press conference CPBD held outside of the Delaware Supreme Court in <span class="xn-location">Dover</span>. While the employees are barred from commenting, they are shown standing behind CPBD Campaign Manager <span class="xn-person">Chris Coffey</span> as he urges the Supreme Court to save the company, its jobs, and <span class="xn-location">Delaware's</span> position as the nation's leader in the incorporation business.

<p id="continue-jump">"We arrived to the hearing with a full bus of TransPerfect employees," said <span class="xn-person">Chris Coffey</span>, Campaign Manager for CPBD. "These employees have been ordered not to speak out against the court, but still risked attending the hearing to fight for their jobs. We hope that Delawareans will see the threat that the Chancery Court's decision poses to <span class="xn-location">Delaware's</span> economy and to more than 4,000 livelihoods. We urge them to sign the petition and stand with us to protect our state and its residents."</p>
CPBD was formed after the <span class="xn-location">Delaware</span> Court of Chancery ordered an appointed custodian to sell TransPerfect amid an internal dispute among company owners. Over the past few months, CPBD has been involved with court proceedings, submitting an amicus brief and arguing that the Court of Chancery appoint a custodian to act as a provisional director until the dispute is resolved – and continues to work with members of legislature to get the bill passed.

"I am concerned that the TransPerfect case will negatively impact the state of <span class="xn-location">Delaware</span> – and I am actively working with Citizens for a Pro-Business Delaware to make sure our state keeps its long and well-deserved reputation as the state where businesses come from around the globe," said Senator <span class="xn-person">Colin Bonini</span>. "We all want the same thing – to keep jobs in <span class="xn-location">Delaware</span> and to keep our state's economy strong."
